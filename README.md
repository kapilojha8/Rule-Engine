## Objectif:
This project aims to develop a student classification system that will assign students to their appropriate classes based on a set of predefined rules.

## Requirements:
- The system needs to receive a list of students, each with a unique ID, sex, age, IQ, assiduity score, and school as inputs.
- The system needs to be able to apply a set of predefined rules to each student.
- The system needs to apply the first matching rule for each student.
- The rules need to be defined based on the student’s attributes. For example, a rule may require a student to be of a certain age, sex, or have a minimum IQ or assiduity score to be assigned to a specific class.
- The system should be able to generate a report that shows each student’s assigned class.
- The system will be designed to handle a large number of students efficiently.
- The system should be easy to use and require minimal technical expertise to operate.
- The system should be scalable, flexible, and easily adaptable to changes in the rules or the student’s attributes.

## Motive:
Overall, the system will ensure that each student is assigned to the most suitable class, which will help to improve their academic performance and overall experience in school.

## Usage:
- Clone or download the repo to your local machine.
- Make sure Python is installed in your machine.
- Make sure the `rule_engine` package is installed.
- Run the program from `src/main.py`.
